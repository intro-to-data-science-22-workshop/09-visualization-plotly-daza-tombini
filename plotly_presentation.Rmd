# 1. Getting started

Today we will learn about `plotly`, an R package that allows you to **build interactive graphs**. 

To illustrate, we'll be working with a dataset that contains the information of all **801 Pokémon** in the world! Every Pokémon species has its own characteristics when it comes to height, weight, attack power, defense power, hit points (stamina)... **Gotta analyze’em all!**

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Please install the Rokemon package
# Make sure you have the "devtools" package, if not, install it first.

###install.packages("devtools")
###library(devtools)

devtools::install_github("schochastics/Rokemon")

# Load the packages
library(Rokemon) # contains data set
library(plotly) # focus of our tutorial
library(tidyverse) # to filter data set
library(dplyr) # additional functions
library(ggplot2) # for comparison 

# Data set
pokemon <- pokemon # Gotta analyze’em all!
```

# 2. Plotly vs Ggplot

- Ggplot provides meaningful, appealing, but _static_ graphs. This limits the users' possibilities to analyse the data.

- Plotly allows users to _interact_  with graphs on a wide variety of forms: zoom in/out of the plot, hover over a point, filter categories, among others.

- Interactive graphs are useful for having a deeper understanding of the patterns of data.

# 3. Examples

## 3A. Using ggplot

Let's take a closer look at the differences by mapping out the relationship between Pokémon's **attack and speed stats** with `ggplot`. 

<details>
  <summary>
  Code
  </summary>
.details[.code120[
```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
pok3a <- ggplot(pokemon, aes(x=attack, y=speed, )) +
  geom_point(shape=1, alpha=0.5) +   
  ggtitle("Fig. 3A: Attack vs Speed ", subtitle = "Built with Ggplot") +
  labs(y="Attack", 
       x = "Speed", 
  caption = "Source: Pokemon")+
  theme_minimal()
```
]]
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
  Plot
  </summary>
.details[.code120[
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=5, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
pok3a
```
]]
</details>

If we wanted to now add each Pokémon's **name** to the plot, it would look like this...

---
# 3. Examples

## 3B. Adding names in ggplot

The results are hard to read.

<details>
  <summary>
  Code
  </summary>
.details[.code120[
```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
pok3b <- ggplot(pokemon, aes(x=attack, y=speed, label= name)) +
  geom_point(shape=1, alpha=0.5) +
  geom_text(size=3, hjust=1, vjust=1) +
  ggtitle("Fig. 3B: Attack vs Speed ", subtitle = "Built with Ggplot") +
  labs(y="Attack", 
       x = "Speed", 
  caption = "Source: Pokemon")+
  theme_minimal()
```
]]
</details>


<details>
  <summary>
  Plot
  </summary>
.details[.code120[
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=5, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
pok3b
```
]]
</details>

---
# 3. Examples

## 3C. Using plotly
`plotly` allows the user to **hover over the individual observations**
and see hover text corresponding to the point on the plot.

<details>
  <summary>
  Code
  </summary>
.details[.code120[
```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
pok3c <- pokemon%>%
  plot_ly(x = ~attack, y = ~speed, type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers',text=~name,
          marker=list(color="blue", size=10))%>%
  layout(title= "Fig. 3C: Attack vs Speed",
         xaxis = list(title = list(text = 'Speed')),
         yaxis = list(title = list(text = 'Attack')))

```
]]
</details>


<details>
  <summary>
  Plot
  </summary>
.details[.code120[
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=5, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
pok3c
```
]]
</details>

Now, you can see each Pokémon's name without clutter. 

---
# 3. Examples

## 3D. Adding more elements to plotly

This graph allows us to map the Pokémon by the game they first appeared in (otherwise known as the variable `generation`).

<details>
  <summary>
  Code
  </summary>
.details[.code120[
```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, fig.width=5, fig.height=4}
pok3d_df <- pokemon
pok3d_df$generation <- as.character(pok3d_df$generation)

# pokemon_gen13$is_legendary[pokemon_gen13$is_legendary == "1"] <- "Legendary"
# pokemon_gen13$is_legendary[pokemon_gen13$is_legendary == "0"] <- "Not legendary"

pok3d <- pok3d_df %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~attack, y = ~speed, color =~generation,
          type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers', text= ~name,
          colors = c("#D64E12", "#F9A52C", "#EFDF48", "#8BD346", "#60DBE8", "#16A4D8", "#9B5FE0")) %>%
  layout(title= "Fig. 3D: Attack vs Speed",
         xaxis = list(title = list(text = 'Speed')),
         yaxis = list(title = list(text = 'Attack')))

```
]]
</details>


<details>
  <summary>
  Plot
  </summary>
.details[.code120[
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=5, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
pok3d
```
]]
</details>


`plotly` lets you filter observations by clicking on the legend.

# 4. Other type of cool plots

Besides scatterplots, you can also create other type of graphics in Plotly such as bubble charts, histograms, box plots, among others. Let's see some cool examples! 

Remember, you can be anything you want to be.

## 4A. Bubble charts

Is there any correlation between capture rate and total stats average of Pokémon types?

In this bubble chart, you can hover over the circles to see what Pokémon type it corresponds to and how many Pokémon belong to that type.

## 4B. Histograms
Let's see how is the distribution of Pokémons' defense and attack stats.

  Code
  </summary>
.details[.code120[
```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, fig.width=5, fig.height=4}

.details[.code120[

Wow! Pokemons' defense and attack points also follow a normal distribution!

# 4. Other type of cool plots

## 4C. Box plots

This boxplot showcases on average how strong (variable `base_total`) the Pokémon in each generation of games are.

# 5. Building your first Plotly graph

## 5A. Let's get started!

There are two ways to do this:

- with the `plot_ly()` function
- with the `ggplot_ly()` function, which translates a ggplot into plotly

We're going to have a more in-depth look at the first option.

# 5. Building your first Plotly graph
## 5A. Let's get started!

_Let's say that I want to have a look at the Pokémon from the first Pokémon game, released
in 1996. My theory is that a Pokémon's hit points total is positively correlated with its defense stat, as a more protected, defensive Pokémon will last longer in battle._

- Choose the `type` argument within `plot_ly()` to determine what kind of plot you want
- Call variables with `~`
- For a full list of attributes and arguments that can be passed along in plotly, `schema()`

- `color()` allows you to create a legend for your plot.
- `colors()` assigns colors to your legend. Supports hexcodes, RBG values...
- `opacity()` modifies observation markers, useful if you have many overlapping ones.
- `hovertext()` is the big deal here. This option is very flexible, so please see plotly's documentation for the full scope of what it's capable of.
- `layout()` enables me to adjust the axis labels, but also supports many other arguments that modify your plot's final appearance. See [here](https://plotly.com/r/reference/#Layout_and_layout_style_objects) for a full list.

# 6. Some extras

## 6A. Exporting plotly graphs as static images

The `orca()` function allows you to do this, although it requires you to [download Orca](https://github.com/plotly/orca), an open source command line tool that interacts with plotly. You can transform your graphs into .jpegs, .pngs, .pdfs...


```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(orca)
orca(pok5b, "pok5b.png")

Some alterations are possible with `style()`. It may be better to build the graph natively in `plotly()` depending on your requirements.

# 7. Conclusion

-> The `plotly` package is a powerful data visualization tool which can bring your plots and graphs to life by making them more dynamic and interactive.

--

-> `plotly` is best used in an digital setting, such as in your browser, in order take full advantage of its functionality.

--

-> The simple function `plot_ly(dataset, x = ~xaxis, y = ~yaxis, type = 'plot')` will get you started with basic functionality. 

--

-> The `hovertext()` function allows you to modify information that is shown when hovering over a point. Many other customizations are possible, and the graph visualization can be adjusted via `layout()`.

--

-> Not every plot requires interactivity and bells and whistles. See what's the best fit for the story your data is trying to tell.
