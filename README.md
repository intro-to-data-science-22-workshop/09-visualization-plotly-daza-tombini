# Data visualization & interactive graphs with plotly


## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-22-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in November 2022. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-22) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2022.

### Session contents

This session will introduce you to the functionalities of graphing package plotly. Plotly enables users to create interactive and dynamic plots that permit a new level of interaction with data, such as additional info when hovering over observations, or embedded filtering functionalities. This package can also render 3D plots that allows viewers to rotate the graphs and view from different angles. It bears similarities to ggplot. 

### Main learning objectives

The goals of this session are to (1) compare plotly's functionalities to popular plotting package ggplot and highlight usage cases, (2) show you the basic functionalities of plotly, and (3) provide you with practice material as well as other sources.
